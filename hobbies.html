		<p>
			Hobbies & Interests<br>
			&bull;I love cooking especially local foods.
			I love it because i like being appreciated
			and complimented. Because trust me
			feels goods when everyone is
			enjoying your masterpiece.&#128521;
			"The work of your hands"<br>
			&bull;I also enjoy watching movies.
			I think this should have topped the
			list because if it were not for any
			obligations, most of my time would
			be spent in front of the screen
			with some large bowl of popcorn&#127871;<br>
			&bull;I am very creative so I love making new
			things and also changing my surrounding.
			When I was little, I used to make crafts
			without any training. It's been a long time
			now, I think I'll have to revisit my skills.<br>
			&bull;I also love taking selfies 
			and then delete them immediately. That's why
			I have very few photos of myself.<br>
			Take a look at my photos below&#128071;,
			few of those that have survived in my gallery.

		        <strong>Favorite movie so far.</strong>
		         It's very interesting, a lot of science,
		         a little bit of love and
		         a lot more of inspiration.
		     	 My favorite actor is DJ Quals, the hacker.</p>
